# Machine Failure Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting machine failures based on data collected from multiple datasets, including telemetry, errors, maintenance, failures, and machines.

## Overview

Machine failures can be costly and disruptive. Predicting when a machine is likely to fail can help organizations plan for maintenance and avoid unexpected downtime. In this project, we leverage data from multiple sources to build a machine failure prediction model.

## Data Sources

The following datasets were used in this project:

1. `telemetry.csv`: Contains telemetry data collected from the machines, including various sensor readings.

2. `errors.csv`: Contains information about errors and warnings generated by the machines.

3. `maintenance.csv`: Contains records of maintenance activities performed on the machines.

4. `failures.csv`: Contains data on historical machine failures.

5. `machines.csv`: Contains information about the machines themselves, such as their age and model.

## Data Preprocessing

Before building the machine failure prediction model, the datasets were preprocessed. This involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, and creating features that would be useful for predicting failures. Some of the preprocessing steps included:

- Merging and aggregating data from different sources.
- Creating time-based features from the telemetry data.
- Labeling instances with information about whether a machine failed within a certain time frame.

## Machine Learning Model

A machine learning model was developed to predict machine failures. This model utilized the preprocessed data from the above datasets. The model was trained to predict whether a machine would fail within a specified future time frame.

## Analysis

### Feature Engineering

The project involved extensive feature engineering to extract relevant information from the raw data. Features such as rolling statistics of telemetry data and error counts were created. Additionally, maintenance events were analyzed to understand their impact on machine performance.

### Model Selection

Several machine learning models were considered and evaluated, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.

### Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance was evaluated using a range of metrics, including:

- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
- Precision: The ability of the model to correctly identify positive cases.
- Recall: The ability of the model to capture all actual positive cases.
- F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- ROC Curve and AUC: To assess the model's ability to distinguish between failure and non-failure instances.

## Results

The performance of the machine failure prediction model was as follows:

- Accuracy: 0.85
- Precision: 0.87
- Recall: 0.82
- F1-score: 0.84
- AUC: 0.91

These results indicate that the model is effective in predicting machine failures with a high level of accuracy. Further analysis can be found in the project's Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
